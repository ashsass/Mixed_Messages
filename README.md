# Mixed Messages Project 
**Description**: This was a project from Codecademy to generate a random output using javascript. I went a little further with the project and made an interactive webpage.

**Languages Used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Usage**: Click the button and it will generate a random cat meme.

You can use the meme generator here on [GitHub Pages](https://ashsass.github.io/Mixed_Messages/)
